		<p>
			Welcome to the website for the Oregon National Primate Research Center.  As one of the seven National Primate Research Centers in the United States, 
			our mandate as a Center is to provide Nonhuman Primate (NHP) resources for the very best scientific programs, both within the Oregon Health & Science 
			University community and beyond.
			<br>
			<br>
			The ONPRC has a unique identity linked to its particular mix of research emphases and nonhuman primate colonies.  We have developed models in the 
			monkeys we study that allow us to ask key questions about aging, metabolic diseases like diabetes, reproductive enhancement, and many others.  
			Much of this opportunity is due to our multi-generational, pedigreed colonies that started to breed here in the early 1960s.  
			<br>
			<br>
			In each of the four Divisions, there are world-class research programs that relate to high-priority medical needs that are expected to increase in 
			importance and funding emphasis over the coming decades.  These include research in aging, AIDS, depression, infectious diseases, substance abuse, 
			obesity, reproductive health, and stem cells.  We are excited to share our recent discoveries with you.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our role is to perform basic research than can inform new treatments or vaccines, and we also have an emphasis on translational research to encourage 
			development of the most advanced ideas into clinical testing.  This side of our research is greatly facilitated by the resources, expertise, and unique 
			capabilities at the ONPRC and our partners at Oregon Health & Science University.  
			<br>
			<br>
			In the pages included here, we have endeavored to give readers a taste of the exciting science we do and how we think it will improve human health. 
			For the general public, we encourage you to explore the About ONPRC tab, as well as Caring for our Animals and Public Outreach.  Dont miss the Photo Gallery  
			For students and teachers, we have sections on Training and Education and Public Outreach.  For scientists, you can find more details under the tabs Science at 
			ONPRC and Research Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			As always, we look forward to hearing from you and to welcoming you to our Center.
			<br>
			<br>
			Nancy L. Haigwood, Ph.D.
			Director
